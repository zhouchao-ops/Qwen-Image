## Quick Start

1. Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)

2. Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

### Text to Image

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", 超清，4K，电影级构图." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "通义千问". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "π≈3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Image Editing

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```


## Show Cases


### General Cases
One of its standout capabilities is high-fidelity text rendering across diverse images. Whether it's alphabetic languages like English or logographic scripts like Chinese, Qwen-Image preserves typographic details, layout coherence, and contextual harmony with stunning accuracy. Text isn't just overlaid, it's seamlessly integrated into the visual fabric.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s1.jpg#center)

Beyond text, Qwen-Image excels at general image generation with support for a wide range of artistic styles. From photorealistic scenes to impressionist paintings, from anime aesthetics to minimalist design, the model adapts fluidly to creative prompts, making it a versatile tool for artists, designers, and storytellers.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s2.jpg#center)

When it comes to image editing, Qwen-Image goes far beyond simple adjustments. It enables advanced operations such as style transfer, object insertion or removal, detail enhancement, text editing within images, and even human pose manipulation—all with intuitive input and coherent output. This level of control brings professional-grade editing within reach of everyday users.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s3.jpg#center)

But Qwen-Image doesn't just create or edit, it understands. It supports a suite of image understanding tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, depth and edge (Canny) estimation, novel view synthesis, and super-resolution. These capabilities, while technically distinct, can all be seen as specialized forms of intelligent image editing, powered by deep visual comprehension.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s4.jpg#center)

Together, these features make Qwen-Image not just a tool for generating pretty pictures, but a comprehensive foundation model for intelligent visual creation and manipulation—where language, layout, and imagery converge.

### Tutorial for Image Editing

One of the highlights of Qwen-Image-Edit lies in its powerful capabilities for semantic and appearance editing. Semantic editing refers to modifying image content while preserving the original visual semantics. To intuitively demonstrate this capability, let's take Qwen's mascot—Capybara—as an example:
![Capibara](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片3.JPG#center)
As can be seen, although most pixels in the edited image differ from those in the input image (the leftmost image), the character consistency of Capybara is perfectly preserved. Qwen-Image-Edit's powerful semantic editing capability enables effortless and diverse creation of original IP content.
Furthermore, on Qwen Chat, we designed a series of editing prompts centered around the 16 MBTI personality types. Leveraging these prompts, we successfully created a set of MBTI-themed emoji packs based on our mascot Capybara, effortlessly expanding the IP's reach and expression.
![MBTI meme series](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片4.JPG#center)
Moreover, novel view synthesis is another key application scenario in semantic editing. As shown in the two example images below, Qwen-Image-Edit can not only rotate objects by 90 degrees, but also perform a full 180-degree rotation, allowing us to directly see the back side of the object:
![Viewpoint transformation 90 degrees](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片12.JPG#center)
![Viewpoint transformation 180 degrees](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片13.JPG#center)
Another typical application of semantic editing is style transfer. For instance, given an input portrait, Qwen-Image-Edit can easily transform it into various artistic styles such as Studio Ghibli. This capability holds significant value in applications like virtual avatar creation:
![Style transfer](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片1.JPG#center)
In addition to semantic editing, appearance editing is another common image editing requirement. Appearance editing emphasizes keeping certain regions of the image completely unchanged while adding, removing, or modifying specific elements. The image below illustrates a case where a signboard is added to the scene. 
As shown, Qwen-Image-Edit not only successfully inserts the signboard but also generates a corresponding reflection, demonstrating exceptional attention to detail.
![Adding a signboard](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片6.JPG#center)
Below is another interesting example, demonstrating how to remove fine hair strands and other small objects from an image.
![Removing fine strands of hair](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片7.JPG#center)
Additionally, the color of a specific letter "n" in the image can be modified to blue, enabling precise editing of particular elements.
![Modifying text color](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片8.JPG#center)
Appearance editing also has wide-ranging applications in scenarios such as adjusting a person's background or changing clothing. The three images below demonstrate these practical use cases respectively.
![Modifying backgrounds](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片11.JPG#center)
![Modifying clothing](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片5.JPG#center)
Another standout feature of Qwen-Image-Edit is its accurate text editing capability, which stems from Qwen-Image's deep expertise in text rendering. As shown below, the following two cases vividly demonstrate Qwen-Image-Edit's powerful performance in editing English text:
![Editing English text 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片15.JPG#center)
![Editing English text 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片16.JPG#center)
Qwen-Image-Edit can also directly edit Chinese posters, enabling not only modifications to large headline text but also precise adjustments to even small and intricate text elements.
![Editing Chinese posters](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片17.JPG#center)
Finally, let's walk through a concrete image editing example to demonstrate how to use a chained editing approach to progressively correct errors in a calligraphy artwork generated by Qwen-Image:
![Calligraphy artwork](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片18.JPG#center)
In this artwork, several Chinese characters contain generation errors. We can leverage Qwen-Image-Edit to correct them step by step. For instance, we can draw bounding boxes on the original image to mark the regions that need correction, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fix these specific areas. Here, we want the character "稽" to be correctly written within the red box, and the character "亭" to be accurately rendered in the blue region.
![Correcting characters](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片19.JPG#center)
However, in practice, the character "稽" is relatively obscure, and the model fails to correct it correctly in one step. The lower-right component of "稽" should be "旨" rather than "日". At this point, we can further highlight the "日" portion with a red box, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fine-tune this detail and replace it with "旨".
![Fine-tuning character](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片20.JPG#center)
Isn't it amazing? With this chained, step-by-step editing approach, we can continuously correct character errors until the desired final result is achieved.
![Final version 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片21.JPG#center)
![Final version 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片22.JPG#center)
![Final version 3](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片23.JPG#center)
![Final version 4](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片24.JPG#center)
![Final version 5](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/幻灯片25.JPG#center)
Finally, we have successfully obtained a completely correct calligraphy version of *Lantingji Xu (Orchid Pavilion Preface)*!
In summary, we hope that Qwen-Image-Edit can further advance the field of image generation, truly lower the technical barriers to visual content creation, and inspire even more innovative applications.
